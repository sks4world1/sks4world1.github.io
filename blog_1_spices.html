    <h1 class="post-title">Blog: Research review of benefits of Spices and Herbs</h1>
    <h2 class="post-subtitle">What you need to know about spices and herbs</h2>
    <p class="post-content">

      Spices hold a treasure trove of antioxidants like polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and more. Dive into the aromatic world of cloves and cinnamon brimming with eugenol, or explore the flavonoid-rich realms of coriander, basil, and red pepper, each with its unique components like quercetin and catechins.
</br> </br>
 
            Delve deeper, and you'll uncover surprising flavonoid champions like parsley, oregano, and saffron, boasting a natural powerhouse of health benefits. Parsley steals the crown with a whopping 4854 mg of flavonoids per 100g, while oregano and saffron flaunt their nutrient-rich profiles at 1550 mg and 205 mg respectively, inviting you to savor their goodness.
</br> </br>

       Spices have been reported to have various beneficial effects on human health which include
anti-sclerotic, antithrombotic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, anti-rheumatic,
gastroprotective, and lipid-lowering action. In addition, spices have radioprotective (protects against
radiation), anti-allergic, and antimalarial effects.
</br> </br>

       Many spices are highly potent antiseptics because they have an antibacterial, antimicrobial,
and even antiviral effect. A synergistic effect on oral bacteria was observed when cloves were used
along with antibiotics.
